/* user.controller.ts */




getUserById
    - do I need to perform checks --> look into where this is called and how to properly modify it


getAllUsers
    - not sure what the intended use behind this is



getAllAdmins
    - modify to pull from the admin collection


getAllProfessionals
    - modify to pull from the pro collection


resetPassword
    - may need a function for pro, client, admin --> tbd depending on frontend approval



changeStatus
    - should pull from pro collection


deleteUser
    - should delete from a specified collection



approveUser
    - should approve pro accounts - doesn't need to check customers


verifyUserEmail
    - may need multiple functions to accomplish this
