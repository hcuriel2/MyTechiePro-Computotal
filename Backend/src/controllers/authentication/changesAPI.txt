/* authentication.controller.ts */

sendResetPwEmail
    - different functions for resetting passwords for admin, pro and user
    - this way I don't have to check each collection to find the correct user


registration
    - the changes will come from the authenticationService 
        - modify them there


loggingIn
    - different functions/checks for each user userType
    - that way i dont have to call multiple collections



loggingOut 
    - no changes


createCookie
    - no changes


createToken
    - need to modify for the different user types

/* authentication.service.ts */


register -- TIES IN WITH registration FROM ABOVE
    - this needs to be modified to handle registration of different user types
        - they will need to be inserted into their associated collection



createToken
    - this may need to be modified to handle different users --> investigate tbh
